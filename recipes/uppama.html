	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Welcome to another tutorial! This time we will look at a typical southern-indian speciality called 
	Uppama.</p>
	<p>Following ingredients will be needed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1/4 cup ghee</li>
		<li>1 cup uncooked creamy wheat cereal, not instant</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon black or yellow mustard seeds</li>
		<li>1/4 cup raw cashews</li>
		<li>2 dried chile de arbol peppers, stemmed</li>
		<li>1 large carrot, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
		<li>1 cup frozen peas</p>
		<li>10 medium frsh curry leaves (optional)</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
		<li>3 cups water</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
		<li>1/4 cup of water</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now follow these steps: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Melt 1/4 cup ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in 
		creamy wheat cereal; toast, stirring frequently, until light brown and
		nutty-smelling, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe the skillet
		with a paper towel.</li>
		<p> </p>
		<li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons ghee in the skillet over medium high
		heat. Add mustards seeds; cover and wait until seed stop popping
		(like popcorn), about 30 seconds. Add cashews and chiles; stir-fry
		until nuts are golden brown and chiles blacken, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
		<p> </p>
		<li>Stir in carrot, peas, curry leaves, and turmeric; stir-fry about 
		2 minutes. Stir in 3 cups water and the salt and bring to a boil. 
		Reduce heat to medium and simmer, covered, until 
		carrots are fork-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
		<p> </p>
		<li>Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in toasted cream of wheat. 
		(It will instantly absorb liquid and begin to swell.) 
		Cover and cook until fully softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; 
		let stand, covered, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
		<p> </p>
		<li>Stir remaining 1/4 cup water if desired for a creamier texture. 
		Sprinkle with cilantro and serve warm.</li>
	</ol>
